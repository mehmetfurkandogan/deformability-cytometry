This repository contains the necessary code for analyzing data from the deformability cytometry project. The three main parts of the project are:

* **PartA:** Size Reduction

* **PartB:** Data Analysis

* **PartC:** Cells Segmentation and Measurement

## Data
Data files are not included in the repository due to their large size. All data should be placed under the "Data"" folder in a way that the folder structure is not altered. (under the subfolders "PartA", "PartB"" and "PartC")
